- I did not test the 'Full server' backup option. 
- The 'VSS copy backup' option backs up all files and preserves application files, including log files.
- Windows Server Backup offers three storage destination types: Hard disk dedicated for backups, Volume, and Shared Network Folder.
The dedicated hard disk type is NOT supported by EXPRESSCLUSTER. Do not use it since a Blue Screen will occur when it is being configured!
- Only the latest backup snapshot will be available in a disaster recovery scenario when there is a need to restore files if the drive is active on the standby server.
- Once the backup storage, which is mirrored by EXPRESSCLUSTER, is failed over to the standby server, VSS functionality is lost. Meaning that only the LATEST snapshot is available to restore from. If trying to restore files from the remote shared server (secondary server), previous snapshots will not show up as available options for restoration. If the mirrored disk is failed back to the primary server, previous snapshots may be visible, but will not allow the user to select files for restoration (a Shadow Copy cannot be found error will occur).
- One scenario we have discovered allows multiple snapshots to be available for recovery after the mirror drive is failed over to the standby server and then failed back to the primary server. The primary server must be rebooted while the backup storage is failed over to the standby server. When the primary server is back online, failback the backup storage drive to the primary server. For some reason, previous snapshots will be available for recovery. Note that rebooting the primary server while it has control of the mirror disk drive, thus forcing a failover to the standby server, also may work, but is not recommended.
- A caveat to the above scenario to make note of for the following case: failover the mirror drive over to the standby server and then failback to the primary server. As mentioned above, the previous snapshots may still be recovered if the primary server is rebooted. But if another backup is made while the drive is controlled by the primary server, previous snapshots will be lost.
